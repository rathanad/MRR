    <string name="historyhead1">Origin and History of Naturopathy</string>
    <string name="historyhead2">Naturopathy in Vedas</string>
    <string name="historycontent1">Nature cure is not a new science. In India, Rishi’s &amp; Muni’s have observed the nature very closely and discovered the laws governing the health and disease.
        They have therefore, propounded a way of life in accordance with the principles that govern health and which is now termed as nature cure principles. \n
        \n Employing natural elements in treating ailments is a century old healing disciple that made its presence felt when drugs and technology were not in vogue.
        Using nature and natural elements was always there and still stands as a constructive, drugless healing process which believes in staying healthy in accordance with the law of nature. \n
        \n In India the history of Naturopathy, the ancient science of healing and art of living can be traced back to the Vedic times. During the ancient times this system of medicine was practiced widely in the country.
        During the ancient times the physicians used to treat the patient’s using natural medicines but would also educate them about a healthy lifestyle.</string>
    <string name="historycontent2">During Vedic period there is a clear concept about medicinal value of water, earth etc. Ganga river water was considered as an instrumental one in curing Heart disease and Arthritis. \n
        \n In Rig Veda fasting was considered as supreme medicine to eliminate accumulated toxins in different parts of human body. \n \n Bhagavat Gita explains about the three varieties of food and its effect on human body and mind.
        Some other practices have drawn its origin from the practice prevalent in Nature like birds, animals etc., we can see that sometimes animals rest to fast and vomit out the unwanted material in the body.
        It takes sun bath in plenty, they get themselves in to water for quite some time, and they cool the body by digging the earth and getting in touch with mud. \n
        \n The revival of Nature Cure started in India by translation of Louis Kuhne’s book “New Science of Healing”. Shri D. Venkat Chelapati Sharma translated the book in Telugu language in about 1894.
        Shri Shroti Kishan Swaroop of Bijnor translated this book into Hindi and Urdu languages in 1904. This gave a wide propagation to this system. \n
        \n However in India the Nature Cure movement gained momentum during the times of Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi was influenced by the book “Return of Nature” written by Adolf Just and became a firm believer of Naturopathy. He included Naturopathy in his constructive programmes.
        In India Nature Cure movement started mainly in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Maharashtra and Gujarat etc., \n
        \n Some of the Naturopaths are Dr. Mahavir Prasad Poddar, Dr. Vegi Raju Krishnam Raju, Dr. Janaki Sharan Varma, Dr. Khushi Ram Dilkash, Dr. S.J. Singh, Dr. Hiralal, Dr. Vittal Das Modi, Dr. Kulranjan Mukherjee, Dr. Sukhram Das, Dr. J. M. Jussawala, Dr. M.M. Bhamgara, Dr. B. Venkat Rao, Dr. B. Vijay Laxmi, Dr. Ganga Prasad Goud “Nahar”,
        Shri Dharam Chanda Saravagi and Acharya K. Laxman sharma etc.  Naturopathy treatments originated as the use of herbs and foods for medicine, exposure to fresh air and sunlight and hydrotherapy as steam or sauna. \n
        \n Nature Cure, as it was called, started in Germany &amp; other western countries with “Water Cure”(Hydro therapy). It was popularized by Vincent Priessnitz who was a farmer. As a result, he was credited as the “Father of Naturopathy”. However the term Naturopathy was coined by Dr. John Scheel in 1895.It was further popularized and propagated by Dr. Benedict Lust.</string>
